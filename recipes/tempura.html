        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a tempura-style fried chicken. Chicken breast or thigh is cut into strips, marinated in soy sauce, garlic, and ginger mixture, coated in tempura batter, and deep-fried.<br>
            But what makes tempura different from other fried fare is its distinctive batter. It uses no bread crumbs and less grease than other frying methods.
